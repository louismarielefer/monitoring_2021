############################################ CONCLUSION
#the Australian bushfire season of 2019-2020 was definitely the worst in the history of Australia
#because it affected both North and East of the country compared to the previous years
#with a high density of fire occurences
#from 2000 to 2019, we observe a shift in fire occurences: form West to North and then from North to East
#these strong bushfires were due to the fact that 2019 was the warmest and the driest year in the history of Australia
#it had severe consequences both on vegetation with an important number of burnt areas
#and on human health with a concentration of fine particles as high as the ones we can find in the most polluted cities in the world
