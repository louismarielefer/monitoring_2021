# we can see in 3D
#maybe in 3D we can see things which don't seem related to each other but maybe they are in 4D
#multivariate analyses is used to reduce the dimensionality and see things we wouldn't be able to see otherwise
#how ? by squizzing dimensions
#one example of squizzing is principle component (PC1 and PC2): from 2 axis to one
