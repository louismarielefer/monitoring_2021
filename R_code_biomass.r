#2 more important functions in a an ecosystem: energy flow and chemical cycle
#1st part: energy flow
plants reflect a lot NIR(near infrared red) and not a lot of red (because red lenghts are absorbed for photosynthesis)
#DIV(indice of biomass)= NIR-RED
#for each zone, a DIV is given
#for each line,lattitude, mean of values
#make of a worldmap with graph on the side which shows where the indice of biomass is the higher
#second part:chemical cycle
#comparison amount of NO2 in europe between january and march (lockdown)
#ADVICE FOR FINAL PROJECT
#either: on a slide, put code on the left and output on the right
#or change slide for output
